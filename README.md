## Welcome
My name is Jacob Siegelman, I'm a software engineer who has been passionate about building stuff with computers for more than half my life.

I spend most of my coding time building websites in Javascript, but I also have experience making Discord bots with Java, procedural art with Processing, data analysis and modeling with MATLAB, and much more. My recent projects include a fully-featured web commerce platform and an online text and video chat app (intentionally) reminiscent of Discord. I'm always looking to collaborate on cool projects, so please contact me if you're interested!

Feel free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-siegelman/) or check my progress on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/jsiegelman/).
